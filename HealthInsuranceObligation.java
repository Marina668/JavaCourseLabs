                In order to meet health insurance requirements, a small business must provide copies of all relevant legal, tax, and accounting information when applying for group coverage. Employers are required to submit certain forms of documentation, including:
                           
                Proof of business location
                Proof of business type
                Payroll 
                This standard information is used to verify and authenticate the legitimacy of a small business, and much of it is available through a previous yearâ€™s business tax filings. Ensuring that your company provides the right documentation can help streamline the process of meeting the health insurance requirements needed to offer group coverage to your employees.""");
